## Game Play
You can only shoot downwards. You can manipulate gravity in 4 directions.
- Up
- Down
- Left
- Right

To shoot you need to change gravity so your feet are facing the enemy.
When manipulating gravity, it only affects you. Most rooms are enclosed as to not let the player fly into the abyss.

To jump, shoot to push the player up. (ie. JetpackJoyRide)

## Design Questions
- **How should gravity be switched as to not be confusing?**
    - For example, should the camera rotate with the player?
        - This would make left/right controls less confusing.  
        - Might be disorientienting, loss sense of direction
    - If the camera doesn't move with the player, controls may get wierd quick
        - For example if gravity is going to the left, should the move left key move the player up?
    - Should the player only be able to rotate left and right or also able to rotate 180?
